#+title: bcmd

bcmd is a shell script that runs a command and emails the output to an email address.

I no longer remember what bcmd standed for when I named it.
Maybe I meant to mean batch command?

bcmd takes two parameters.
The _t_ parameter takes the email address that the output will be sent to.
The _c_ parameter takes the command.

Below is the example, if you would like to lock your computer screen every 10 minutes.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
bcmd -t someone@localhost -c "ls /"
#+END_SRC

The source code is written in the literate programming style.
